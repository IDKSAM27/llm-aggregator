day 1:I'll be trying to make a LLM(large language models) aggregator.
    Let's see how much deep I get into this project.
    (llm works according to how we train the language, e.g., human intervention or RLHF(Reinforcement learning with human feedback))

    providing a single interface to talk to any of the multiple LLM.

    create a library where I expose some endpoints and users can hit those endpoints to get responses.

    day 1 will include learning about the specific topic like llm

day 2:Trying to complete the learning of the LLM
