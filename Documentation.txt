day 1:I'll be trying to make a LLM(large language models) aggregator.
    Let's see how much deep I get into this project.
    (llm works according to how we train the language, e.g., human intervention or RLHF(Reinforcement learning with human feedback))

    providing a single interface to talk to any of the multiple LLM.

    create a library where I expose some endpoints and users can hit those endpoints to get responses.

    ispiration: ollama

    day 1 will include learning about the specific topic like llm

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

day 2:Trying to complete the learning of the LLM 
    Update: completed LLM.

day 3:Setting project expectations and goals, or atleast trying to set goals. A rought idea how our LLM aggregator should be.

An LLM aggregator is a system that integrates multiple large language models to perform tasks like combining their capabililties.
It acts as a middle layer between users and LLMs.

    Key Features(of my LLM Aggregator):

    1. Model Selection: Automatically chooses the best LLM based on the query, task or user preferences.

    2. Collaboration: Merges outputs from multiple LLMs to improve response accuracy and diversity.

    3. Cost Optimization: Firstly I'll use free API's and in the future maybe I'll go with paid if it is actually worth.

    4. Specialization: Routes domain-specific queries (like, programming, medical, legal) to the most suitable model.

    5. Fallback Mechanism: Uses alternative models if the primary one fails or give poor results.

    (will add up later if needed in the future!)

**imp

1. Defining use case:
    * Aggregator will handle general-purpose queries
                        or
      Focus specific domains(like, coding, content writing, data analysis).

    * List of Free API's:



2. Choosing a Development Stack:
    * Prog. Lang.: Python
    * Frameworks and Tools:
        FastAPI or Flask (build API's)
        LangChain (to manage interactions with LLM's)
        LLS API's (Integrates API's)

3. Integrate LLMs:

4. Implement Query Routing:
    * if code related go to gpt-4-coding 
    or if medical go to claude-medical

5. Combine Outputs:

6. Create a User Interface:
    * CLI: Simple command-line interface for basic usage.
    * Web App: Use Streamlit, Gradio, or a custom front-end with React/Vue.
    * Chatbots: Integrate into platforms like Discord, Slack, or Telegram.

7. Optimize Performance:
    * Implement caching with tools like Redis to store recent responses.
    * Use rate-limiting and monitor API usage to manage costs.
    * Scale using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

8. Test and Deploy:
    * Extensive testing
    * Deploy using Docker, Kubernates, or directly on cloud services.
